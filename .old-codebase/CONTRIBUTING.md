# Contributing

Thanks for contributing to ADE! Keep changes focused and deterministic so deployments remain predictable.

## Commit messages

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for every commit. The `type(scope): subject` format keeps automation predictable and helps with changelog generation. Examples:

- `feat(api): add job retry endpoint`
- `fix(docs): correct admin CLI flag`
- `chore(ci): refresh docker cache`

## Pull requests

Keep pull requests small and scoped. Describe the behaviour change, testing performed, and any follow-up work in the PR description. Update relevant docs, including the changelog, whenever behaviour changes.
