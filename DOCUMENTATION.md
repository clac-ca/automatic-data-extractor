# Documentation strategy

## Purpose
ADE is configuration-driven. Deployments remain stable while configurations evolve, so the documentation must teach every reader how to operate, govern, and change configurations safely. Content must render cleanly in GitHub and within the in-app viewer, giving the same navigation, context, and cross-links in both places.
