## Goal
- Bulletproof the CLI for multi-agent usage: atomic writes, locking, validation, and helpful discovery commands.

## Tasks
- Implement atomic `writeJson` + coarse lock around index mutations.
- Validate workpackage payloads against a JSON schema during create/update/show.
- Add `find`, `tail`, and `board` commands for daily ergonomics.
- Update docs + legacy notes to reflect new guarantees/commands.

## Progress
- 2025-10-20T01:35:49.929Z • jkropp: Starting hardening: add atomic writes + lock, schema validation, and new find/tail/board commands.
- 2025-10-20T01:42:39.079Z • jkropp: Implemented atomic writes with coarse lock, schema validation, and added find/tail/board commands.
- 2025-10-20T01:42:59.454Z • jkropp: Docs updated (AGENTS.md, README) and commands validated via list/find/board/tail.
