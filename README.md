# ADE — Automatic Data Extractor

Automatic Data Extractor (ADE) ingests semi-structured documents and turns them into tabular datasets. The project ships as a FastAPI backend with an in-process worker and optional React frontend. Operators interact with ADE exclusively through the HTTP API, which keeps automation, UI, and integrations aligned.

- **Deterministic jobs** – Extraction logic is revision-controlled so reruns produce identical outputs.
- **Workspace aware** – Every request is scoped to a workspace through URL paths like `/workspaces/{workspace_id}` for simple multi-tenancy.
- **Single API surface** – Upload documents, run jobs, inspect events, and fetch results through the same FastAPI application.

## Documentation

Guides now live under the [`docs/`](docs/README.md) directory:

- [User Guide](docs/user-guide/README.md) – core workflows for documents, jobs, results, and events.
- [Admin Guide](docs/admin-guide/README.md) – deployment, configuration, and operational building blocks.
- [Reference glossary](docs/reference/glossary.md) – shared terminology across API payloads and database entities.

## Quickstart (local)

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .[dev]
uvicorn backend.api.main:app --reload
```

The FastAPI application is created in [`backend/api/main.py`](backend/api/main.py). Configuration is loaded once at startup using the `Settings` model defined in [`backend/app/config.py`](backend/app/config.py) and cached on `app.state.settings`.

Open <http://localhost:8000/docs> to explore the autogenerated OpenAPI documentation. Toggle documentation endpoints by setting `ADE_ENABLE_DOCS=false` in your environment.

## Architecture snapshot

ADE follows a modular layout under `backend/api/modules/`:

- [`documents`](backend/api/modules/documents) – multipart uploads, metadata, downloads, and deletions.
- [`jobs`](backend/api/modules/jobs) – submission, status, and background execution via the in-process task queue.
- [`results`](backend/api/modules/results) – table retrieval by job or document.
- [`events`](backend/api/modules/events) – immutable audit trail with workspace scoping.
- [`auth`](backend/api/modules/auth) – password, SSO, and API key flows plus access-control decorators.
- [`workspaces`](backend/api/modules/workspaces) – routing helpers and dependencies that enforce workspace-scoped URLs.

Supporting infrastructure lives in `backend/api/core/` and `backend/api/db/`, including structured logging, message hubs, and async SQLAlchemy sessions.

Uploaded files and the SQLite database are stored beneath the `backend/data/` directory by default. Override locations with the `ADE_DATA_DIR`, `ADE_DATABASE_URL`, or `ADE_DOCUMENTS_DIR` environment variables when deploying to production systems.

> **Coming soon**
> Containerised deployment notes (including local Docker usage and Azure Container Apps guidance with environment variable examples) will live alongside the admin guide once the workflows stabilise.

## Status

The backend is under active development. The high-level concepts above are stable; deeper guide content is being authored iteratively so it can track ongoing feature work without churn.
