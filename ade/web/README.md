# ADE Web Build Artefacts

This directory is populated by the frontend build step (`npm run build` under `frontend/`).
The generated files are ignored in git to keep the repository free of compiled assets.
Run the bundled helper (`ade start --rebuild_frontend`) or the npm build manually to
refresh the contents when working locally.
