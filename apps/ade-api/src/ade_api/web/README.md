# ADE Web Build Artefacts

This directory is populated by the frontend build step (`ade build` or `npm run build` under `apps/ade-web/`).
The generated files are ignored in git to keep the repository free of compiled assets.
Run `ade build` from the repository root to refresh the contents when working locally.
