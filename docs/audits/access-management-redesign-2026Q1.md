# Access Management Redesign Archive Index (2026 Q1)

## Purpose

Provide provenance links for access-management redesign research and decisions,
while directing operators and developers to canonical docs.

## Canonical Documentation (Current)

- [Access Management Model](../explanation/access-management-model.md)
- [Access Reference](../reference/access/README.md)
- [Access Management API Reference](../reference/api/access-management.md)
- [Manage Users and Access](../how-to/manage-users-and-access.md)
- [Auth Operations](../how-to/auth-operations.md)
- [Access Management Incident Runbook](../troubleshooting/access-management-incident-runbook.md)

## Historical Design Package

Historical package path:

- `docs/access-management-redesign/`

Use for:

1. decision rationale
2. option matrices
3. research evidence and external source anchors
4. implementation planning lineage

## Provenance Notes

1. Canonical operational docs now live under standard `explanation/how-to/reference/troubleshooting` sections.
2. Redesign package remains for historical traceability and audit purposes.
3. Future behavior changes should update canonical docs first, then optionally append audit notes.
