Prerequisites: ADE account with appropriate permissions and access to the frontend once it is available.
When to use: Share with reviewers and operators who rely on the UI to process documents.
Validation: Confirm TODO placeholders exist for upcoming walkthroughs and link back to configuration and operations support where needed.
Escalate to: Support lead when UI workflows change or troubleshooting steps expand.

# User workflow primer

Front-end documentation will land here once the UI stabilises. Until then, use this README to point end users toward operational contacts and upcoming guides.

## Planned guides (TODO)

- `upload-and-queue.md` — submit documents and monitor ingestion status.
- `monitor-and-review.md` — interpret job outputs and audit notes.
- `download-and-share.md` — export structured results securely.
- `troubleshooting.md` — resolve common UI issues and know when to escalate.

For urgent assistance, direct users to the [Operations](../operations/README.md) section or the support distribution list documented in service runbooks.
