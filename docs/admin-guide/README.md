# Admin Guide

Administrators install, configure, and operate the Automatic Data Extractor. This guide captures the durable pieces of that workflow while deeper runbooks are drafted.

## Deployment at a glance
- ADE is a FastAPI application created in [`backend/api/main.py`](../../backend/api/main.py) with its settings defined in [`backend/api/settings.py`](../../backend/api/settings.py).
- The service boots with `uvicorn backend.api.main:app --reload` for local development. Production deployments typically run under a process manager such as systemd or inside a container.
- Persistent state lives under the `backend/data/` directory by default. SQLite databases and uploaded documents sit beneath `backend/data/db/` and `backend/data/documents/`; both paths can be overridden through environment variables.

## Configuration snapshot
- Settings are loaded once at startup through `get_settings()` and cached on `app.state.settings`. Routes and background workers read from this state rather than reloading environment variables on every request.
- Environment variables use the `ADE_` prefix (for example `ADE_DATABASE_URL`, `ADE_MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES`). A local `.env` file is respected during development.
- Documentation endpoints (`/docs`, `/redoc`, `/openapi.json`) default on for the `local` and `staging` environments and can be
  toggled explicitly through the `ADE_ENABLE_DOCS` flag to keep production surfaces minimal.

## Operational building blocks
- Database connections are created via the async SQLAlchemy engine in [`backend/api/db/engine.py`](../../backend/api/db/engine.py) and scoped sessions from [`backend/api/db/session.py`](../../backend/api/db/session.py).
- Background work is handled by the in-process task queue defined in [`backend/api/core/task_queue.py`](../../backend/api/core/task_queue.py) and message hub in [`backend/api/core/message_hub.py`](../../backend/api/core/message_hub.py).
- Structured logging and correlation IDs are configured through [`backend/api/core/logging.py`](../../backend/api/core/logging.py) and middleware in [`backend/api/extensions/middleware.py`](../../backend/api/extensions/middleware.py).

Future sections will expand on installation commands, security hardening, and deployment runbooks (including Docker quickstarts and Azure Container Apps walkthroughs via CLI and portal). The components listed above are already in place and unlikely to change dramatically.
