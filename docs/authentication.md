# Authentication Architecture

This document explains how requests are authenticated in Automatic Data Extractor (ADE), how the FastAPI dependencies enforce
permissions, and what operators should consider when extending the system. It complements the RBAC documentation by focusing on
identity, session, and credential handling.

## Identity Sources

ADE recognises three credential types and normalises them into an `AuthenticatedIdentity` object before any route code runs:

1. **Session cookies** – the primary browser flow. The access token lives in the session cookie and the refresh token is issued in
a sibling cookie with the same session identifier. CSRF tokens are minted alongside the JWT pair and must accompany mutating
requests.【F:backend/app/features/auth/service.py†L305-L370】
2. **Bearer access tokens** – typically produced by the `/auth/session` endpoints. They are decoded with the same signing secret as
sessions and skip CSRF enforcement because they are intended for non-browser clients.【F:backend/app/features/auth/dependencies.py†L33-L68】
3. **API keys** – created through the admin UI or API. The raw token is shown once and clients must provide it via the
`X-API-Key` header. API keys reuse the principal model so they participate in the same RBAC assignments.【F:backend/app/features/auth/dependencies.py†L69-L90】【F:backend/app/features/auth/service.py†L52-L103】

`get_current_identity` prefers bearer tokens, then session cookies, then API keys. Regardless of the path, the dependency
ensures the backing `User` has a corresponding `Principal` record so downstream permission checks operate on principals
exclusively.【F:backend/app/features/auth/dependencies.py†L33-L90】

## Session Lifecycle

* `AuthService.start_session` issues a new session identifier, access token, refresh token, and CSRF token. The tokens embed the
session identifier and hashed CSRF token so a refresh can rotate everything while keeping the same session id when desired.
* `AuthService.apply_session_cookies` writes the access and refresh cookies with `httponly`, `lax` SameSite, and a refresh path
tied to `/api/v1/auth/session/refresh`. Secure cookies are used whenever the request is served over HTTPS.【F:backend/app/features/auth/service.py†L305-L370】【F:backend/app/features/auth/service.py†L420-L468】
* `require_csrf` runs on every mutating endpoint. It only enforces CSRF for session-cookie identities and delegates to
`AuthService.enforce_csrf`, which compares the hashed token in the JWT with the submitted value.【F:backend/app/features/auth/dependencies.py†L105-L128】

## Single Sign-On (OpenID Connect)

### Configuration

* Provide `ADE_OIDC_CLIENT_ID`, `ADE_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET`, `ADE_OIDC_ISSUER`, `ADE_OIDC_REDIRECT_URL`, and `ADE_OIDC_SCOPES` to enable the flow. ADE always authenticates as a confidential client, so the secret is required. The redirect URL should point at the SPA callback route (`/auth/callback`), which finalises the login before forwarding the user to their requested destination. Supplement this with `ADE_AUTH_FORCE_SSO` when you are ready to disable password-based logins entirely, and use `ADE_AUTH_SSO_AUTO_PROVISION` if you need to pause automatic account creation.【F:.env.example†L58-L66】【F:frontend/src/app/routes/auth.callback.tsx†L1-L74】
* The settings layer normalises scopes, enforces HTTPS issuers and redirect URLs, and converts relative callbacks against `server_public_url`.【F:backend/app/shared/core/config.py†L331-L399】【F:backend/app/shared/core/config.py†L436-L459】
* When those settings are present, `/auth/providers` automatically publishes a "Single sign-on" option so the login page advertises SSO alongside the credential form. Leave `ADE_AUTH_FORCE_SSO=false` during rollout so the inaugural administrator can continue signing in with their password, then flip it once the identity provider login is verified.【F:backend/app/features/auth/service.py†L143-L166】【F:frontend/src/app/routes/login.tsx†L1-L74】

### Login flow

* `AuthService.prepare_sso_login` signs a short-lived state token, requires PKCE S256, and only permits return targets that resolve to same-origin paths before redirecting to the provider.【F:backend/app/features/auth/service.py†L700-L756】【F:backend/app/features/auth/service.py†L816-L860】
* The state cookie is issued as `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax`, and scoped to the API SSO prefix so the callback can validate it without exposing it to other routes.【F:backend/app/features/auth/router.py†L487-L566】
* Provider discovery and JWKS fetches enforce HTTPS, block private hosts, respect bounded timeouts, and reject oversized or non-JSON responses.【F:backend/app/features/auth/service.py†L628-L698】【F:backend/app/features/auth/service.py†L758-L817】【F:backend/app/features/auth/service.py†L1032-L1112】
* The SPA callback route reads the IdP query parameters, invokes `/api/v1/auth/sso/callback`, and redirects to either the stored `return_to` hint or the user’s preferred workspace once the backend issues cookies.【F:frontend/src/app/routes/auth.callback.tsx†L1-L74】【F:frontend/src/app/routes/login.tsx†L1-L74】
* Token exchange responses must include a bearer `id_token`/`access_token` pair; the service allows only RS256/ES256 signatures, validates issuer, audience, nonce, and time claims with small leeway, and refreshes JWKS data when a signing key is unknown.【F:backend/app/features/auth/service.py†L817-L939】【F:backend/app/features/auth/service.py†L939-L1031】

### Provisioning policy

* `AuthService._resolve_sso_user` trusts the IdP email, reuses matching users, and auto-provisions new accounts with the default global role when `ADE_AUTH_SSO_AUTO_PROVISION` is true; otherwise it blocks new users until an administrator invites them. Conflicting subjects or disabled accounts produce actionable errors rather than silent merges.【F:backend/app/features/auth/service.py†L1386-L1459】
* The callback records the desired return path from state, resets lockout counters, and returns both the session envelope and the post-login redirect hint to the frontend.【F:backend/app/features/auth/service.py†L864-L906】【F:backend/app/features/auth/router.py†L168-L205】
* The setup API echoes the `force_sso` flag so the wizard can warn operators that the credential form disappears once forced SSO is enabled, preserving a predictable path for the break-glass administrator they create during initial setup.【F:backend/app/features/auth/router.py†L49-L78】【F:frontend/src/app/routes/setup._index.tsx†L1-L58】

## Security Dependencies

All feature routers include the shared dependencies from the auth and roles modules so that OpenAPI documents the
requirements and the responses are consistent.【F:backend/app/features/auth/dependencies.py†L87-L130】【F:backend/app/features/roles/dependencies.py†L1-L94】

* `require_authenticated` guarantees a `User` is attached to the request. All routers mount this dependency once so individual
handlers can assume an authenticated context.【F:backend/app/features/auth/dependencies.py†L95-L103】
* `require_global(<permission>)` and `require_workspace(<permission>)` call the principal-aware `authorize` helper to enforce
RBAC assignments. Workspace guards derive the scope identifier from path or query parameters and emit structured 403 payloads
when access is denied.【F:backend/app/features/roles/dependencies.py†L14-L68】
* `require_permissions_catalog_access` protects the permissions catalogue endpoints and handles both global and workspace
scopes. It reuses the same forbidden payload shape and performs scope validation for workspace requests.【F:backend/app/features/roles/dependencies.py†L70-L109】
* `require_csrf` must wrap every mutating route. A regression test walks the FastAPI routing table to ensure that any POST,
PUT, PATCH, or DELETE endpoint is guarded, excluding a small allowlist for session bootstrap flows.【F:backend/tests/api/test_csrf_guards.py†L1-L51】

## RBAC Integration

After authentication, route-level guards always authorise using the principal identifier attached to the identity. Global and
workspace permissions are evaluated through the `authorize` facade, which resolves assignments, roles, and permissions using the
unified RBAC tables. Any failure produces a consistent 403 payload with the permission key and scope metadata to aid debugging
and client UX.【F:backend/app/features/roles/dependencies.py†L14-L109】【F:backend/app/features/roles/authorization.py†L1-L123】

## Extending the System

When introducing a new endpoint:

1. Mount the router with `dependencies=[Security(require_authenticated)]` so every request resolves an identity.
2. Add `Security(require_global(...))` or `Security(require_workspace(...))` to the endpoint signature with the exact permission
key that should gate access.
3. Include `dependencies=[Security(require_csrf)]` (or add it to the decorator) for any mutating route that should honour CSRF.
4. If the endpoint accepts a workspace id outside the default `workspace_id` parameter name, pass `scopes=["{<param>}"]` to the
workspace guard so `_resolve_workspace_param` picks it up.
5. Update tests to cover success and denial cases, and extend the RBAC work package if the permission model changes.

When adjusting authentication behaviour, update:

* `docs/authentication.md` (this document) with the new flow or credential type.
* `AGENTS.md` with a short note summarising the change for future automation runs.
* The security dependencies so OpenAPI stays accurate, and the CSRF regression test if new bootstrap routes are added.

## Troubleshooting Checklist

* **401 responses** usually mean `get_current_identity` could not resolve any credentials. Check token expiry, cookie domain, and
API key status.
* **403 responses** surface the required permission and scope. Confirm the principal has the right role assignment.
* **422 invalid_scope errors** arise when a workspace id is missing or named incorrectly. Ensure the route passes
`scopes=["{workspace_id}"]` or sets `scope_param` when calling `require_workspace`.
* **CSRF failures** occur when browser clients forget to send the `X-CSRF-Token` header that matches the cookie-issued token.

Keeping these pieces aligned ensures ADE’s authentication remains predictable, auditable, and easy to extend.
