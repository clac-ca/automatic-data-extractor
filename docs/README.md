# ADE Documentation Hub

Welcome to the Automatic Data Extractor (ADE) documentation. The guides are organised by persona so that readers can focus on the tasks that matter to them.

- [User Guide](user-guide/README.md) – walkthroughs for uploading documents, submitting extraction jobs, and retrieving results.
- [Admin Guide](admin-guide/README.md) – installation, configuration, security, and operational runbooks for the ADE backend.
- [Reference](reference/glossary.md) – shared terminology covering API entities and identifiers.

Each guide links back to concrete FastAPI routes and services inside the repository. Example requests use the same environment variables as the codebase (`ADE_` prefixes) so they can be copy-pasted into local setups.

> **Tip**
> Start with the User Guide to understand the job lifecycle, then dive into the Admin Guide when you need to deploy or customise ADE for your environment.
