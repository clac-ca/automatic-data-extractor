# ADE Documentation Hub

Welcome to the Automatic Data Extractor (ADE) documentation. We are publishing the guides incrementally, starting with the developer experience.

- [Developer Docs](developers/README.md) – deep dive into how ADE processes spreadsheets, the artifact model, and how to reason about jobs.

Planned sections (coming soon):
- User Guide – walkthrough of the frontend experience, from uploading documents to tracking job runs.
- Admin Guide – installation, configuration, security, and operational runbooks for the ADE backend.
- API Guide – developer reference for integrating with the ADE HTTP API.
- Glossary – shared terminology covering API entities and identifiers.

Check back as we expand each persona-focused guide, and reach out if you spot gaps or need a topic prioritised.
