# ADE Documentation Hub

Welcome to the Automatic Data Extractor (ADE) documentation. The guides are organised by persona so that readers can focus on the tasks that matter to them.

- [User Guide](user-guide/README.md) – conceptual walkthrough of the upcoming frontend experience, from uploading documents to collaborating on results.
- [Admin Guide](admin-guide/README.md) – installation, configuration, security, and operational runbooks for the ADE backend.
- [API Guide](reference/api-guide.md) – developer reference for integrating with the ADE HTTP API.
- [Glossary](reference/glossary.md) – shared terminology covering API entities and identifiers.

Each guide keeps jargon to a minimum and links to additional resources where needed so you can adopt ADE at your own pace.

> **Tip**
> Start with the User Guide to understand the job lifecycle from a user’s perspective, then dive into the API Guide or Admin Guide when you are ready to automate or operate the platform.
