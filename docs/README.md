# ADE Documentation Hub

Welcome to the ADE (Automatic Data Extractor) docs. ADE turns messy spreadsheets into clean, normalized workbooks through a configurable, multi‑pass pipeline.
We’re publishing the docs incrementally, starting with the **Developer** experience.

## Start here

* **[Developer Docs](developers/README.md)** — how ADE processes spreadsheets, how jobs run, and how to configure behavior with code.

* **User guide** *(coming soon)* — frontend walkthrough: uploading files, monitoring jobs, reviewing results.

* **Admin guide** *(coming soon)* — installation, configuration, security, and operational runbooks.

* **API guide** *(coming soon)* — HTTP API reference for integrating ADE into other systems.

> If something is missing or unclear, please open an issue or PR. Your feedback shapes the docs roadmap.
