# ADE Backend

This directory contains the unified ADE backend distribution, including the API (`ade_api`), worker (`ade_worker`), and shared infrastructure packages (`ade_db`, `ade_storage`).

Backend Python source now lives under `backend/src/`.

Use the root `ade` CLI (installed from this distribution) to run or test services.
