# Task 23 – Config package: recommended layout + examples

Checklist: G) Provide recommended folder layout + examples (registry flexible).

Objective: Publish the “one file per column” recommended structure while keeping registry flexible.

Implementation steps:
- [ ] Add layout section to `docs/config-package-conventions.md` showing `columns/`, `rows/`, `hooks/`, optional `utils/` (use ASCII tree from workpackage).
- [ ] Ensure template `config_package_example` folder structure matches recommendation and stays discoverable by import_all.
- [ ] Include minimal code samples for column module, row detector, and hook that align with the new decorators.

Definition of done:
- [ ] Docs and template clearly present recommended layout; discovery works regardless of layout.
