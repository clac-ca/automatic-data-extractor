# Work Package: Frontend Rebuild\n\n## Status\n- **Owner:** Experience Squad\n- **Last Reviewed:** 2025-10-10\n- **State:** _Execution_\n- **Notes:** Fresh Vite scaffold, shell layout, login/setup flows, and API client are in place. Next focus: design system primitives, authenticated workspace surfaces, navigation redesign (header tabs + document rail), end-user login polish, `/auth/callback` handling, and test coverage.\n\n## Objective\nRebuild the ADE single-page application with a standard React + TypeScript\nstack. Deliver only the flows required for day-to-day operations while aligning\nwith the updated authentication and setup contracts.\n\n## Deliverables\n- Vite + React + TypeScript project initialised with ESLint, Prettier, Vitest,\n  and Testing Library using upstream defaults.\n- Routing shell with authentication guard, shared layout chrome, and feature\n  routes built on React Router v6.\n- Shared UI primitives (button, input, card, modal) styled with Tailwind.\n- TanStack Query configuration plus a typed `apiClient` for authenticated\n  requests and error handling.\n- Authentication workflow: session resource (`GET/POST/DELETE /auth/session`,\n  `POST /auth/session/refresh`), `/auth/providers` integration, credential form,\n  provider redirect, logout, and first-run setup wizard via `/setup`.\n- Feature scaffolds for workspace overview and configuration detail with typed\n  data hooks.\n- Frontend README covering scripts, environment configuration, routing map, and\n  contribution expectations.\n- Baseline tests for routing guard, setup wizard, login validation, and data\n  hooks.\n\n## Implementation Guidance\n- Anchor UI tokens in `tailwind.config.ts` (color palette, spacing, radius) and consume them through utility classes; avoid inline style drift across features.\n- House reusable primitives under `frontend/src/ui/` with prop-driven variants rather than bespoke screen-level styling; keep accessibility baked in (focus traps, ARIA labels).\n- Route-level data should come from TanStack Query hooks that wrap `frontend/src/shared/api/client.ts`; mutations must reuse the shared CSRF-aware client helpers.\n- Prefer composition over global state: let React Router loaders/queries drive layout state, and keep session/workspace context limited to providers already defined in `AppProviders`.\n- When extending auth/setup flows, mirror backend schemas in `frontend/src/shared/api/types.ts` and add Vitest + Testing Library coverage alongside the change.\n- Follow AGENTS.md heuristics—clarity over cleverness, deterministic behaviour, and boring abstractions—before introducing new dependencies or optimisations.\n- Keep workspace-level navigation in the shell header (active workspace selector, overview/documents tabs) and reserve the left rail for document-centric context (recent uploads, presence indicators) to reinforce workspace scoping.\n- Ensure SSO surfaces include a `/auth/callback` route that completes the redirect flow and feeds back into session hydration.\n\n## Progress Snapshot\n- Rebuilt `frontend/` from scratch (archived legacy app in `frontend.old/`), configured Tailwind 3.x, React Router, React Query, and updated developer docs.\n- Implemented `AppProviders`, `AppRouter`, `ShellLayout`, and `RequireSession`, providing authenticated chrome plus placeholder routes for admin, workspaces, jobs, documents, and settings.\n- Delivered initial auth/setup flows (session query, login with SSO discovery, setup status + provisioning mutation) and wired logout redirect handling.\n- Updated backend asset pipeline: `ade start --rebuild-frontend` now publishes bundles to `ade/web/static/`; Docker/CLI/docs reflect the new location.\n- Shared UI primitives ( `src/ui`) now expose buttons, inputs, alerts, and form helpers to keep feature screens consistent. \n- Workspace shell now persists active selection, shows breadcrumbs, and provides placeholder routes for per-section views.\n- Header navigation now surfaces workspace-scoped tabs (overview/documents) with a document rail scaffold in the sidebar ready for real-time presence indicators.\n- Added an `AppShell` wrapper so `/workspaces`, `/workspaces/new`, and `/workspaces/{id}/…` all share the same header/profile chrome; the workspace layout now passes tabs, sidebar content, and workspace switcher into that shell.\n- Outstanding work includes expanding workspace-specific UI, introducing data visualisations, wiring document/job routes, enriching the document rail with live data, completing `/auth/callback` backend wiring, and covering flows with Vitest.\n\n### Layout & Navigation Progress (2025-10-18)\n- Canonicalised workspace routing with a React Router loader that resolves slugs to IDs, writes the active workspace to storage, and primes the React Query cache for nested routes.\n- Centralised workspace section metadata in `frontend/src/app/workspaces/sections.ts`, eliminating duplicated label/path constants across the router, shell layout, and placeholder routes.\n- Refactored `WorkspaceLayout` to consume loader data through a dedicated `WorkspaceProvider`, ensuring breadcrumbs, navigation tabs, and profile menus derive from a single workspace context.\n- Replaced the mock document drawer with `frontend/src/features/documents/components/WorkspaceDocumentRail.tsx`, powered by a TanStack Query hook and per-workspace pin persistence.\n- Introduced `WorkspaceDirectoryLayout` so index and detail routes share consistent AppShell composition and admin profile menu wiring.\n\n### Patterns to Carry Forward\n- `frontend/src/app/AppProviders.tsx` centralises React Query defaults (limited retries, dev-only devtools) and must wrap the router.\n- `frontend/src/shared/api/client.ts` handles CSRF, base URLs, and Problem Details—use it for all HTTP interactions.\n- `frontend/src/app/AppRouter.tsx` separates public and authenticated routes; keep guard logic (`RequireSession`) near the top-level router.\n- `frontend/src/app/layouts/ShellLayout.tsx` will host the header-level workspace tabs and the document rail; evolve it rather than replacing it wholesale.\n- Add future shared components under `frontend/src/ui/` to keep feature code lean and consistent.\n\n### Architecture Review (2025-02-14)\n**Current layout**\n- `AppRouter` wraps the private tree in `RequireSession`, then fans into the workspace router where placeholders stand in for unfinished surfaces while a loader resolves the active workspace.【F:frontend/src/app/AppRouter.tsx†L1-L59】\n- `WorkspaceLayout` currently couples loader data priming, preferred-workspace persistence, permission gating, navigation composition, and the document rail wiring inside a single component.【F:frontend/src/app/layouts/WorkspaceLayout.tsx†L22-L140】\n- `AppShell` fetches the session internally to build the profile menu, so every layout that renders it subscribes to `useSessionQuery` instead of receiving session data from above.【F:frontend/src/app/layouts/AppShell.tsx†L1-L164】\n- `WorkspaceDirectoryLayout` and the index route re-run session permission checks and recreate shell chrome outside the workspace loader stack.【F:frontend/src/app/layouts/WorkspaceDirectoryLayout.tsx†L13-L34】【F:frontend/src/app/routes/WorkspacesIndexRoute.tsx†L12-L101】\n- The document rail owns persistence effects and fetching logic rather than consuming workspace data supplied by the router or context.【F:frontend/src/features/documents/components/WorkspaceDocumentRail.tsx†L28-L94】\n\n**Gaps vs. playbook / simplification opportunities**\n- `/login`, `/setup`, and workspace creation screens still manage form state with `useState` instead of the React Hook Form + Zod stack called for in the design guardrails.【F:frontend/src/app/routes/LoginRoute.tsx†L12-L118】【F:frontend/src/app/routes/SetupRoute.tsx†L22-L166】【F:frontend/src/app/routes/WorkspaceCreateRoute.tsx†L33-L220】【F:agents/FRONTEND_DESIGN.md†L56-L140】\n- Session data is fetched repeatedly in `AppShell`, `WorkspaceLayout`, `WorkspaceDirectoryLayout`, and the workspaces index, leading to multiple query subscribers and scattered permission checks.【F:frontend/src/app/layouts/AppShell.tsx†L50-L65】【F:frontend/src/app/layouts/WorkspaceLayout.tsx†L53-L138】【F:frontend/src/app/layouts/WorkspaceDirectoryLayout.tsx†L13-L34】【F:frontend/src/app/routes/WorkspacesIndexRoute.tsx†L12-L101】\n- Document rail state (pins, collapse) lives in component-local effects, making it harder to share across future surfaces or to hydrate from loader data aligned with `workspaceSections` descriptors.【F:frontend/src/features/documents/components/WorkspaceDocumentRail.tsx†L28-L94】【F:frontend/src/app/workspaces/sections.ts†L21-L136】\n\n### Sustainability & Maintainability Review (2025-02-20)\n- Layout modules mix data orchestration, provider wiring, and presentation in one file, making reuse and testing harder. `WorkspaceLayout` defines nested layout components, mutates React Query caches, and persists preferred workspace IDs inside the component body instead of delegating those responsibilities to route loaders and dedicated UI primitives.【F:frontend/src/app/layouts/WorkspaceLayout.tsx†L22-L140】\n- `AppShell` remains stateful, invoking the session query and logout mutation directly. That prevents Storybook or test harnesses from rendering the shell without live hooks and forces every consumer to pay an extra network call.【F:frontend/src/app/layouts/AppShell.tsx†L50-L164】\n- Directory-level screens still reconstruct shell chrome and permission logic locally rather than consuming a shared authenticated layout contract, which risks drift in navigation labels and profile menus as features expand.【F:frontend/src/app/layouts/WorkspaceDirectoryLayout.tsx†L13-L34】【F:frontend/src/app/routes/WorkspacesIndexRoute.tsx†L12-L101】\n- Route components and loaders follow mixed naming conventions (`WorkspaceLayout`, `WorkspacePlaceholderRoute`, `workspaceLoader`) and live in separate directories, so adding suspense or error boundaries requires broad imports rather than encapsulated route folders.【F:frontend/src/app/AppRouter.tsx†L23-L48】【F:frontend/src/app/workspaces/loader.ts†L1-L60】\n- Form routes rely on mutable React state instead of shared schema-driven helpers, so validation rules, default values, and submission behaviour are duplicated and harder to internationalise or audit.【F:frontend/src/app/routes/LoginRoute.tsx†L12-L118】【F:frontend/src/app/routes/SetupRoute.tsx†L22-L166】【F:frontend/src/app/routes/WorkspaceCreateRoute.tsx†L33-L220】\n\n**Proposed improvements**\n- Introduce an `AuthenticatedApp` router layout that runs a loader to hydrate the session and workspace directory once, exposes them via context providers, and renders `AppShell` as a pure presentational component so nested routes inherit consistent chrome without re-querying.【F:frontend/src/app/AppRouter.tsx†L23-L59】【F:frontend/src/app/layouts/AppShell.tsx†L50-L164】\n- Split `WorkspaceLayout` into a route module that handles loader data, query priming, and preferred-workspace persistence, and a `WorkspaceChrome` component that only accepts props for navigation, permissions, and sidebar config. This keeps context logic aligned with `workspaceSections` while making it easier to add real documents/configurations routes.【F:frontend/src/app/layouts/WorkspaceLayout.tsx†L22-L140】【F:frontend/src/app/workspaces/sections.ts†L21-L136】\n- Refactor login, setup, and workspace creation to use shared React Hook Form + Zod schemas, mapping backend validation errors through consistent helpers and unlocking richer inline validation and accessibility messaging per the design spec.【F:frontend/src/app/routes/LoginRoute.tsx†L12-L118】【F:frontend/src/app/routes/SetupRoute.tsx†L22-L166】【F:frontend/src/app/routes/WorkspaceCreateRoute.tsx†L33-L220】【F:agents/FRONTEND_DESIGN.md†L56-L140】\n- Extract a `useDocumentRailState` helper (persisted via `createScopedStorage`) and allow the rail to accept preloaded document summaries so loaders or future real-time sources can hydrate pins and collapse state without reimplementing effects in each layout.【F:frontend/src/features/documents/components/WorkspaceDocumentRail.tsx†L35-L94】\n- Pass profile metadata and actions into `AppShell` via props to decouple it from `useSessionQuery`, which simplifies testing, Storybook usage, and eventual multi-tenant profile menus while avoiding redundant network calls.【F:frontend/src/app/layouts/AppShell.tsx†L50-L164】\n- Add explicit `errorElement`/`pendingElement` components for the workspace route so loader failures render actionable messaging instead of falling back to blank screens or generic router errors.【F:frontend/src/app/AppRouter.tsx†L23-L46】\n- Co-locate each routed surface under a directory that bundles the route component, loader, and error boundary (for example, `frontend/src/app/routes/workspaces/detail/`) to follow React Router best practices and keep naming predictable.【F:frontend/src/app/AppRouter.tsx†L23-L59】\n- Promote `AppShell` into a prop-driven layout under `frontend/src/ui/layouts/` so it can be composed by Storybook stories, tests, and nested routers without importing query hooks by default.【F:frontend/src/app/layouts/AppShell.tsx†L50-L164】\n- Introduce shared form utilities (React Hook Form adapters, schema exports under `frontend/src/shared/validation/`, and an error-mapping helper) and migrate existing forms to them, reducing bespoke state and improving maintainability.【F:frontend/src/app/routes/LoginRoute.tsx†L12-L118】【F:frontend/src/app/routes/SetupRoute.tsx†L22-L166】【F:frontend/src/app/routes/WorkspaceCreateRoute.tsx†L33-L220】\n\n### Environment & Build Hooks\n- `VITE_API_BASE_URL` drives the HTTP base URL (defaults to `/api/v1`); the backend serves the SPA from `ade.main.start(rebuild_frontend=True|False)`.\n- `VITE_SESSION_CSRF_COOKIE_NAME` overrides the cookie the `ApiClient` reads when sending `X-CSRF-Token`. Leave it unset to use `ade_csrf`.\n- Development workflow remains `npm install`, `npm run dev`, `npm run build`, and `npm test -- --watch=false`. Keep those scripts intact in the regenerated project.\n\n### Data Shapes to Honour\n- `SessionEnvelope` → `{ user, expires_at, refresh_expires_at, return_to? }`; `user` matches `SessionUser` (`user_id`, `email`, status flags, roles, permissions, `preferred_workspace_id`).\n- `AuthProvider` → used for SSO tiles (`id`, `label`, `icon_url`, `start_url`) plus `force_sso` flag from `/auth/providers`.\n- `WorkspaceProfile` → supplies navigation: `id`, `name`, `slug`, `roles`, `permissions`, `is_default`.\n- `WorkspaceMember`, `RoleDefinition`, `DocumentTypeDetailResponse`, `ConfigurationSummary`, and `JobRecord` fuel the planned feature screens; keep their field names aligned with backend responses in `frontend/src/shared/api/types.ts`.\n- Successful setup (`POST /setup`) and login return `SessionEnvelope` and set `ade_session`/`ade_refresh` cookies. CSRF enforcement applies to every mutating route except setup and initial session creation.\n\n## Backend API Contracts (`/api/v1`)\nAll paths below already apply the API prefix (`/api/v1`). Mutating routes require `X-CSRF-Token` unless noted. Workspace-scoped endpoints inherit `require_workspace` permission checks.\n\n### Setup & Session\n| Method | Path | Purpose | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GET | `/setup/status` | Determine whether first-run setup is still required | Public;

The `test_csrf_guards.py` suite will fail if new mutating routes omit `require_csrf`, so ensure the frontend always attaches the CSRF header (the shared `ApiClient` already does this).\n\n## Milestones & Tasks\n### M0 — Alignment & Visual Direction\n1. Reconfirm requirements across `AGENTS.md`, `docs/authentication.md`, and `agents/FRONTEND_DESIGN.md`; document any deltas in this work package.\n2.
